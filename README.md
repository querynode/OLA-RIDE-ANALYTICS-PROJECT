# OLA-RIDE-ANALYTICS-PROJECT
In this project, I analyzed Ola ride booking data to uncover insights into customer behavior, ride patterns, and business performance. The dataset included ride details such as customer ID, booking ID, pickup/drop locations, ride status (completed/canceled), payment methods, and fare amounts.
